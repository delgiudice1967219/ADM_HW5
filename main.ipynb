    "1. Arya can make at most `k` stops during her trip (this means up to `k+1` flights).\n",

    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "700  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Arya's optimal path with at most 1 stop is `0 → 1 → 3`, costing 100 + 600 = 700 euros.  \n",
    "The path `0 → 1 → 2 → 3` is cheaper but requires 2 stops, which violates the constraints.\n",

    "**Explanation:**  \n",
