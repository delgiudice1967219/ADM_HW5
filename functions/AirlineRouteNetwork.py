class FlightNetwork:
    """
A class to represent and analyze a flight network, where airports are nodes and flights are directed edges 
with weights corresponding to the distance between airports. The class allows adding flights, computing 
shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm, and finding the best routes between airports for a given date.

Methods:

add_flight(origin, destination, distance): Adds a flight between two airports to the network.

shortest_paths(start): Computes the shortest paths from a starting airport to all other airports using Dijkstra's algorithm.

find_best_routes(origin_city, destination_city, date, flights): Finds the best routes between origin and 
destination cities for the given date based on available flights.

Functions: 

information_collection(flights):

Allows the user to select a departure city, destination city and flight date from a DataFrame of flights. 
Filters the data based on the user's choices and returns the selected information (Origin city name, Destination city name and considered date).
